# Smartphone App to turn the text into speech
The Smartphone App was developed using MIT App Inventor. Copyright (c) 2012-2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The app is constantly reading a Google Spreadsheet, in which the recognized text from images is written, with a while loop. If the text from the spreadsheet is different than the text in the last iteration (i.e. if there is new recognized text), it is turned into speech. The file Visionplusplus.aia can be imported to http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/ for implementation.
