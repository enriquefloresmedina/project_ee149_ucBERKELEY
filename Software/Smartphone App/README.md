# Smartphone App to turn the recognized text into speech
The Smartphone App was developed using MIT App Inventor. Copyright (c) 2012-2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The app is constantly reading a Google Spreadsheet that contains the recognized text from images, with a while loop. If the text from the spreadsheet is different than the text in the last iteration (i.e. if there is new recognized text), it is turned into speech. It also allows the user to modify parameters of the text to speech service. The file Visionplusplus.aia can be imported to http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/ for implementation. The blocks of code are shown in CodeBlocks.png
