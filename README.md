# EECS149/249 Vision++ project
Vision++ is a glove designed to empower low vision people, by turning any readable text into speech. By simply pressing a button, the glove captures an image and, if it contains any text, it is automatically turned into speech in a smartphone app, making it easy to hear with headphones or the phoneâ€™s speaker.
